        From wikipedia:
        <blockquote>An apple is a sweet, edible fruit produced by an apple tree (Malus pumila). Apple trees are
            cultivated
            worldwide and are the most widely grown species in the genus Malus.he tree originated in Central Asia,
            where its wild
            ancestor, Malus sieversii, is still found today. Apples have been grown for thousands of years in Asia and
            Europe and
            were brought to North America by European colonists </blockquote>
